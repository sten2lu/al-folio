Did you ever want to use a state-of-the-art segmentation Machine Learning algorithm (March 2022) for your machine learning dataset but did not know how?

Then I hope that this workshop about nn-UNet will help you to do that. All you need is a Google Account to familiarize yourself with nnU-Net's end-user experience.

If you want to use nnU-Net for your own projects, I would advise you to have a GoogleColab Pro account, use some Cloud Computing infrastructure, or a workstation with a dedicated Nvidia graphics card with at least 12Gb of VRAM.

Everything is explained in the Jupyter Notebook in the Repository and the slides (pdfs).
