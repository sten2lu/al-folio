I am a PhD Student in the Interactive Machine Learning Group at the DKFZ headed by Dr. Paul JÃ¤ger, where my main area of research is Deep Active Learning, a subfield of Machine Learning.
On the side, I am one of the organizers of [heidelberg.ai](https://heidelberg.ai) a community with over 2200 members where we host events to encourage scientific discussions about artificial intelligence.

Further, I have past working experiences and am still interested in the fields of Deep Generative Methods and Anomaly Detection. 

Until recently, I studied physics at the University of Heidelberg, focusing on Computational Physics.

Generally, I like to read widely because: "You never know what you don't know".
But Deep Learning, Physics, Psychology, Programming, and Statistics have captured my mind for a long time now. 

Also, during my free time I never let a chance pass by to entertain myself with some fiction, just to let my imagination run wild.
Whenever I am neither reading nor working, I probably do something like wakeboarding, bouldering, playing piano, cooking, meeting friends, or programming.

I am even writing something on my blog from time to time -- you might want to check it out.
