To keep things classical I will keep this as theme for my first Blogpost. 
Thereby: Greetings to You, I hope you are having a wonderful day! 

## Facts
The classical "Hello, World!" Program which every programmer and also many non-programmers know. 
It is so influential that it even got into pop culture. But now while searching for some facts for you I realize that I was completely wrong about its origin. 

"Hello World"
- origin: example program in the seminal 1978 book "The C Programming Language"
- "Time to hello world" or TTHW is used as a measure for ease of use of a programming language

Now this was enough information retrieval from wikipedia for the day. For more I encourage you to visit the [information source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) every non-academic (and academic uses but refuses to admit it) and read more information for yourself about various variations as well as some code snippets.
